# drc
A simple work in progress open source reddit client for android. Designed mostly for personal use and as a tool for getting more familiar with the Android SDK, it is meant to combine most of the good features of other commercially available Reddit clients and fix some annoying design decisions.

# Main Features (so far)
- Browsing subreddits, posts, comments
- Post/comment sorting
- Root comment navigation
- Post search
- Basic submit and reply functionality (needs work)
- Login/logout

# TODO list
- OAuth2 support
- Support for multiple accounts
- Reply drafts
- Support for managing subreddit subscriptions
- Internal web browser for articles
- Support for imgur posts (incl galleries/albums)
- Support for LaTeX in math related subreddits (not sure how to do this)
- Better animations
- Subreddit sidebars
- Browsing user profiles/posts
- Better networking (Volley or something similar)
